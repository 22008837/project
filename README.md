## Smart Wastewater pH Monitoring and Alert System

Small Description:

The Smart Wastewater pH Monitoring and Alert System is designed to continuously monitor the pH level of wastewater in real time and provide instant alerts when abnormal conditions are detected, ensuring environmental safety and efficient water management.

## About
The Smart Wastewater pH Monitoring and Alert System is an IoT-based project developed to monitor the acidity and alkalinity of wastewater using real-time sensors and automated alert mechanisms. Wastewater discharged from industries and residential areas can significantly impact the environment if pH levels exceed permissible limits.

Traditional wastewater monitoring methods rely on manual sampling and laboratory testing, which are time-consuming and prone to delays. This project overcomes these limitations by integrating pH sensors, a microcontroller, and cloud-based monitoring to provide continuous observation and instant alerts.

The system detects abnormal pH values and notifies authorities through alerts, enabling timely corrective action. This solution improves efficiency, reduces environmental risks, and supports sustainable wastewater management practices.

## Features
Real-time monitoring of wastewater pH levels
Automated alert system for abnormal pH values
